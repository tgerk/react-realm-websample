# A sample react web client app

I developed this graphql webclient through iterations on a sample app.  I plan to use as a jumping-off point for further development in different app/user contexts.

## Interesting features

I'm proud of my layout and factorization of components and services, as well add-ons to the initial create-react-app.  Particularly:

- contexts for User (onelogin), Service (realm), Protocol (graphql)
- avoidance of inline CSS, pure semantic classes & elements
